#  Data Structures and Algorithm

**Q1- what is Data Structure ?** <br />
A1- Structure of the Data, can be anything, most commonly use are:
- **string** ( any character )
- **number/integer** ( any number )
- **boolean** ( true and false )
- **null** ( kinda hard to explain - let's say value is nothing - type is specified - not true in some cases )
- **undefined** ( same as null but value is not been removed or never specified )
- **object** ( combination of other data types )
- **array** ( list of other data types )

**Q2- what is algorithm ?** <br />
A2- Algorithm is in simple a step to do anything, like a recipe to cake, but what it do with data so in this situation we can say algorithm is the way to step of code you write to achieve the business logic
